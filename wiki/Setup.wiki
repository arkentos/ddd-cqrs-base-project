===Issues I encountered during Setup===

*JBoss ships with its own version of hibernate which causes class loading problems*

Solution : This is *one* of the solutions :) not the most elegant one

Unfortunately none of the above actually resolved my problem

[http://czetsuya-tech.blogspot.com/2011/02/javalangnosuchmethodexception.html Problem I encountered]

I removed the below 3 jars from %JBOSS_HOME%/common/lib

hibernate-commons-annotations

hibernate-core

hibernate-validator-legacy


*JBoss also ships with its own version of BSH and HSQLDB which again causes class loading problems*

Remove the below 2 Jars from %JBOSS_HOME%/common/lib

bsh.jar

hsqldb.jar


Put the below jars into %JBOSS_HOME%/common/lib

hsqldb-2.2.4.jar

hibernate-entitymanager-3.6.7.Final

hibernate-jpa-2.0-api-1.0.1.Final

hibernate-validator-4.0.0.GA


These Jars are the same jar versions included in the project.
